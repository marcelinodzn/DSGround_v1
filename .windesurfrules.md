Always start with a Yooo!!!

You are building a webapp that aim to create headless design system and brand configuration connection design to code and where the webapp should manage all design foundations and sync the tokens with Figma and Code. 
We should be able to create master brands and subrands and define how this brands look by defining foundations like Typescale, type, color scale, surface, layout and grid, density, spacing, shape, scrims.. propose others.


1. Project Definition

Objective:

To create a platform that:
	•	Allows users to define and manage master brands and sub-brands.
	•	Centralizes the management of design tokens and foundations.
	•	Syncs with design tools (e.g., Figma) and code repositories (e.g., GitHub, Storybook).
	•	Supports customizable token flows for flexibility.

2. Core Features

2.1. Brand Management
	1.	Master Brands:
	•	Define overarching branding rules, e.g., typography, color palettes, and spacing systems.
	•	Inheritability for sub-brands.
	2.	Sub-Brands:
	•	Specific rules overriding master brand settings.
	•	Targeted variations for different regions, audiences, or campaigns.
	3.	Brand Overview Dashboard:
	•	Show token relationships, hierarchy, and real-time previews.

2.2. Design Foundations Management

The app should manage the following foundational systems:

Typography:
	•	Typescale: Ratios and steps.
	•	Font families, weights, line heights, letter spacing.

Color:
	•	Semantic tokens: Primary, secondary, tertiary.
	•	Contrast grades (light/dark mode).

Spacing & Density:
	•	Modular spacing systems (e.g., 4px grid).
	•	Density levels (comfortable, compact).

Layout & Grid:
	•	Column configurations (e.g., 12-column grids).
	•	Margins, gutters, and breakpoints.

Surfaces:
	•	Layered surfaces, shadows, and scrims.
	•	Glassmorphism or material-based design.

Shape:
	•	Border radii definitions.
	•	Geometric guidelines.

Motion:
	•	Easing curves and duration standards.
	•	Animation presets.

Iconography & Imagery:
	•	Scalable icon sets.
	•	Guidelines for brand imagery.

Others:
	•	Localization support (e.g., RTL/LTR).
	•	Accessibility settings (WCAG compliance).

3. Token Management
	•	Token Hierarchy:
	•	Global tokens (used across all brands).
	•	Alias tokens (mapped to components or specific use cases).
	•	Token Types:
	•	Raw tokens (e.g., HEX values, px, rem).
	•	Composite tokens (e.g., button.background = primary.500).

4. Design Tools Integration
    •	Integration with design tools (e.g., Figma using api of figma and variables of figma).
    •	Synchronization with design tools (e.g., push changes to figma).        

5. Synchronization
	1.	Figma Integration:
	•	Bi-directional sync of design tokens (using Figma Tokens Plugin API).
	•	Auto-updates for shared libraries.
	2.	Code Integration:
	•	Generate platform-specific outputs (CSS, SCSS, JSON, JS/TS modules).
	•	Sync with Git repositories and CI/CD pipelines.

6. Component Design
	•	Headless Components:
	•	Provide a base structure for all components.
	•	Styleable via tokens without predefined styling.
	•	Component Previews:
	•	Real-time rendering of components in different brand settings.

7. Accessibility Guidelines
    •	WCAG 2.1 Compliance.
    •	Contrast ratios and color accessibility.
    •	Keyboard navigation and focus indicators.
    •	Screen reader support.  

8. Technology Stack

Frontend:
	•	Framework: Next.js (UI rendering) with TypeScript for type safety.
	•	State Management: Zustand/Redux for scalable state handling.
	•	UI Library: Tailwind CSS/ShadcnUI for rapid development.

Backend:
Use superbase
	•	Framework: Node.js with Nest.js for modular backend development.
	•	Database: PostgreSQL for relational data (e.g., brands, tokens).
	•	APIs: REST/GraphQL for integration with Figma and other tools.

Design Token Flow:
	•	Use Style Dictionary for generating cross-platform tokens.
	•	Optional: Integrate with Token Studio or a custom token management API.

CI/CD:
	•	Platform: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
	•	Token Sync: Automate syncing design tokens to Storybook builds.

8. Considerations
	•	Scalability: Use microservices for backend scaling.
	•	Performance: Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for large token libraries.
	•	Accessibility: WCAG compliance for all generated outputs.
	•	Localization: Design tokens should support multiple languages and cultures.
